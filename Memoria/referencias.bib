	abstract = {The outlier detection problem has important applications in the field of fraud detection, network robustness analysis, and intrusion detection. Most such applications are high dimensional domains in which the data can contain hundreds of dimensions. Many recent algorithms use concepts of proximity in order to find outliers based on their relationship to the rest of the data. However, in high dimensional space, the data is sparse and the notion of proximity fails to retain its meaningfulness. In fact, the sparsity of high dimensional data implies that every point is an almost equally good outlier from the perspective of proximity-based definitions. Consequently, for high dimensional data, the notion of finding meaningful outliers becomes substantially more complex and non-obvious. In this paper, we discuss new techniques for outlier detection which find the outliers by studying the behavior of projections from the data set.},

Numerous ensemble-based algorithms have been proposed in the literature for these problems. Compared to the clustering and classification problems, ensemble analysis has been studied in a limited way in the outlier detection literature. In some cases, ensemble analysis techniques have been implicitly used by many outlier analysis algorithms, but the approach is often buried deep into the algorithm and not formally recognized as a general-purpose meta-algorithm. This is in spite of the fact that this problem is rather important in the context of outlier analysis. This paper discusses the various methods which are used in the literature for outlier ensembles and the general principles by which such analysis can be made more effective. A discussion is also provided on how outlier ensembles relate to the ensemble-techniques used commonly for other data mining problems.},

The authors cover how outlier ensembles relate (both theoretically and practically) to the ensemble techniques used commonly for other data mining problems like classification. The similarities and (subtle) differences in the ensemble techniques for the classification and outlier detection problems are explored. These subtle differences do impact the design of ensemble algorithms for the latter problem. This book can be used for courses in data mining and related curricula. Many illustrative examples and exercises are provided in order to facilitate classroom teaching. A familiarity is assumed to the outlier detection problem and also to generic problem of ensemble analysis in classification. This is because many of the ensemble methods discussed in this book are adaptations from their counterparts in the classification domain. Some techniques explained in this book, such as wagging, randomized feature weighting, and geometric subsampling, provide new insights that are not available elsewhere. Also included is an analysis of the performance of various types of base detectors and their relative effectiveness. The book is valuable for researchers and practitioners for leveraging ensemble methods into optimal algorithmic design.},

	abstract = {With the increasing advances in hardware technology for data collection, and advances in software technology (databases) for data organization, computer scientists have increasingly participated in the latest advancements of the outlier analysis field. Computer scientists, specifically, approach this field based on their practical experiences in managing large amounts of data, and with far fewer assumptions– the data can be of any type, structured or unstructured, and may be extremely large. Outlier Analysis is a comprehensive exposition, as understood by data mining experts, statisticians and computer scientists. The book has been organized carefully, and emphasis was placed on simplifying the content, so that students and practitioners can also benefit. Chapters will typically cover one of three areas: methods and techniques commonly used in outlier analysis, such as linear methods, proximity-based methods, subspace methods, and supervised methods; data domains, such as, text, categorical, mixed-attribute, time-series, streaming, discrete sequence, spatial and network data; and key applications of these methods as applied to diverse domains such as credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, earth science, web log analytics, and social network analysis are covered.},

	abstract = {The problem of detecting a small number of outliers in a large dataset is an important task in many fields from fraud detection to high-energy physics. Two approaches have emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised. Supervised approaches require a sufficient amount of labeled data and are challenged by novel types of outliers and inherent class imbalance, whereas unsupervised methods do not take advantage of available labeled training examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. We propose {BORE} (a Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervised outlier scoring functions ({OSFs}) as features in a supervised learning framework. {BORE} is able to adapt to arbitrary {OSF} feature representations, to the imbalance in labeled data as well as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost. We demonstrate the good performance of {BORE} compared to a variety of competing methods in the non-budgeted and the budgeted outlier detection problem on 12 real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {Classifier learning with data-sets that suffer from imbalanced class distributions is a challenging problem in data mining community. This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.},

Multiple classifier systems ({MCS}) provide a natural way to solve {DF} on the decision level by training individual classifiers separately on its own data source and then combine their outputs. In this paper, we consider a dynamic selection ({DS}) framework to select and fuse competent classifiers of {MCS}. For this, we propose a competence estimation and selection method to improve the performance of the {DF} system especially under class imbalance. We evaluate the method with synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework.},

In this context, data analysis can significantly improve the state-of-the-art techniques, employed, for instance, to determine if a particular component or product is showing an anomalous behavior with respect to a defined nominal state. In fact, through the analysis of data collected on field, it is possible to detect optimal operating regions and to detect anomalies in advance. In this context, we propose a multi-purpose algorithm for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning in order to determine a simple continuous region of points. This region can be adopted in order to describe a component or a product nominal behavior and can be used in order to detect anomalies which are outside it. Such a region can be defined adopting a finite ensemble of thresholds, whose value can be physically interpreted. In order to show the effectiveness of our approach, the proposed method has been tested in an Anomaly Detection problem concerning Predictive Maintenance, exploiting data coming from a naval vessel, characterized by a combined diesel-electric and gas propulsion plant.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of the several components of a Ship Propulsion Systems is an onerous activity, which need to be efficiently programmed by a shipbuilding company in order to save time and money. The replacement policies of these components can be planned in a Condition-Based fashion, by predicting their decay state and thus proceed to substitution only when really needed. In this paper, authors propose several Data Analysis supervised and unsupervised techniques for the Condition-Based Maintenance of a vessel, characterised by a combined diesel-electric and gas propulsion plant. In particular, this analysis considers a scenario where the collection of vast amounts of labelled data containing the decay state of the components is unfeasible. In fact, the collection of labelled data requires a drydocking of the ship and the intervention of expert operators, which is usually an infrequent event. As a result, authors focus on methods which could allow only a minimal feedback from naval specialists, thus simplifying the dataset collection phase. Confidentiality constraints with the Navy require authors to use a real-data validated simulator and the dataset has been published for free use through the {OpenML} repository.},

	abstract = {In many real-world applications, data is collected in high dimensional spaces. However, not all dimensions are relevant for data analysis. Instead, interesting knowledge is hidden in correlated subsets of dimensions (i.e., subspaces of the original space). Detecting these correlated subspaces independently of the underlying mining task is an open research problem. It is challenging due to the exponential search space. Existing methods have tried to tackle this by utilizing Apriori search schemes. However, their worst case complexity is exponential in the number of dimensions; and even in practice they show poor scalability while missing high quality subspaces. This paper features a scalable subspace search scheme (4S), which overcomes the efficiency problem by departing from the traditional levelwise search. We propose a new generalized notion of correlated subspaces which gives way to transforming the search space to a correlation graph of dimensions. We perform a direct mining of correlated subspaces in this graph, and then, merge subspaces based on the {MDL} principle in order to obtain high dimensional subspaces with minimal redundancy. We theoretically show that our search scheme is more general than existing search schemes. Our empirical results reveal that 4S in practice scales near-linearly with both database size and dimensionality, and produces higher quality subspaces than state-of-the-art methods.},
